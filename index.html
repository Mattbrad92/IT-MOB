    <h3>Team Name (IT MOB)</h3>
    <h3> Personal information </h3>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h3>  Team Profile  </h3>
    <p>(I was thinking we can have a page set up for each member of the team with a link at the top including your persaonal results from the 16 personalites etc)</p>

                                                    <h1>Ideal Jobs </h1>

<p>
    Compare and contrast the ideal jobs for each person in the group. This may have changed due to feedback from Assignment 1.
    What common elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the others, if anything? How similar or different
    are your career plans across the group?
    It can be tackled numerous ways in writing and in visual elements. A concise coverage/analysis/conclusion covering all would be
    good. Strongly recommend a table presentation of comparison data. As it is very easy to highlight a lot of information, simple for
    others to read and interpret too

</p>
                                                    <h1>Tools</h1>

<p>  Having set up an individual website in Assignment 1, you should now set up a group website, using the same approach. You
    should then include links to each individual website on the group website.
    You also need to set up a GitHub repository for your group on which you can use Git. This is to facilitate the production and
    maintenance of group artifacts, which will include the assignment submission, but may also include other reports or information,
    code, examples, formatted data, images and videos, links, and similar information.
    You will also need to set up your group on Canvas.
    In your report you should include a brief description of what you have done, and include the following:
    <ul>
    <li> The link to your group’s website</li>
    <li>The link to your group’s Git repository (GitHub)</li>
    <li>Your comments on how well the audit trail on the Git repository reflects your group’s work. You will presumably only be able to do this close to the time of submission.</li>
</ul>
    GitHub Invite Collaborators: https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository
    MS Teams information, meetings, notes, and links (etc.) should be included in this section too.
    </p>

                                                <h1>Industry Data</h1>

<p>In Canvas on the Assignment 2 page, you will find a link to some industry data supplied by Burning Glass. You should use this (as
    well as any other data you may be able to find) to answer the following questions. If you’re to be looking outside of the IT field, find
    similar data for your specific Industry.
    <ul>
    <li> What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?</li>
    <li>From your group's ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group's
    required skill set). These can be divided into general skills (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific
    skills (Javascript, SQL, etc).</li>
</ul>
    <li>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</li>
    <li>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</li>
    <li>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</li>
    <li>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</li>
    <li>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</li>
</p>
                                                    <h1>IT Work</h1>

<p>The IT industry is large, varied and changes over time. It also easy to get a misleading impression of what is typically involved on
    a day-to-day basis from a job advertisement or a position description. In order to help you understand this, the best way seems to
    be to hear from some IT professionals about their daily work. There are two ways in which you can do this, as below.
   <ul>
    <li> Interview an IT professional</li>
     <li>i>View, summarise and discuss at least 10 YouTube videos or other web sources (you may be surprised how many hits</li>
</ul>
    there are for a Google search on A day in the life of an IT professional).
    You as a group need to choose one of these two approaches. If it all possible, it is strongly recommended that you (as a group)
    interview an IT professional. Not only will this information be more direct, it may provide you with a contact that you will find helpful
    in the future. If you choose this option, you will find on the Assignment 2 page on Canvas a list of questions to ask as a starting
    point and some basic training in how to go about this interview.
    Include raw transcripts / recordings in appendix to support your written component.
    If you choose the web sources option, you need to report on 5 different IT professionals, as well as indicate your 10 sources.
    Whichever source of information you use, you should answer the following questions.
    <ul>
    <li>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</li>
    <li>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The
    general public?</li>
    <li>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</li>
    <li>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</li>
</ul>
    </p>
                                                    <h1>IT Technologies</h1>

<p>  
    There are a lot of fascinating developments going on in the IT world, many of which may fall by the wayside, but some of which
    are likely to change the way the world works. Historic examples of such developments include the Internet, smartphones, cloud
    computing and public-key cryptography.
    In this section you should report on 4 of the areas below.
    <ul>
    <li>Clouds, services, servers</li>
    <li>Cybersecurity</li>
    <li>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</li>
    <li>Machine Learning</li>
    <li>Autonomous vehicles</li>
    <li>Natural Language processing and chatterbots</li>
    <li> Robots</li>
    <li> Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices</li>
</ul>
    Some starting points and other information will be made available on Canvas.
    For each of the areas covered, you should report on the following.

    <ol>
        <li>What does it do? (600 words)</li> 
        <li>What is the state of the art of this new technology? 
        <li>What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </li>
        <li>What technological or other developments make this possible?</li>
Answer here..............................


        <li>What is the likely impact? (300 words) </li>
        <li>What is the potential impact of this development?</li>
        <li>What is likely to change? </li> 
        <li>Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</li>

Answer Here...............................
        <li>How will this affect you? (300 words)</li>
        <li>In your daily life, how will this affect you? </li>
        <li>What will be different for you? </li>
        <li>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</li>
Answer Here...............................
</ol>
    </p>

                                                <h1>Project Ideas</h1>
    <p>You all have some project ideas that you reported in Assignment 1. You are to come up with a project idea for the group as a
        whole, which could be an individual’s idea, but is more likely to be a combination of each of the ideas you had individually (maybe
        an entirely new IT Project Idea proposal), together with comments and feedback from your Assignment 1 marker, instructor, and
        anyone else who you would like to consult.
        You may also wish to consider what problems need to be solved, for which there are many sources of information, such as the
        ones below. There are many more websites like these, of course.
        <ul>
        <li>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/what-are-the-10-biggest-global-challenges/</li>
            <li>https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/want-to-be-a-billionaire-solve-one-of-these-5-problems.html/?a=viewall</li>
                <li>https://www.quora.com/What-are-common-problems-that-need-solving</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
        There is no set length for this section, but it is difficult to see how a description of less than 1500 words would be adequate. Do
        not limit yourself to this if you have more than this to write, though - but it should be in a well written and concise format.
        Expand the Overview, Motivation, Description, Tools + Tech, Skills, Outcome items from Assignment 1. Adapt it using the
        feedback received and the developments/suggestions from your group members. Put weight behind innovative components and
        ensure the project is feasible [no sci-fi / pie-in-the-sky] to make steps beyond a simple proposal/plan. Perhaps look towards
        identifying niche/markets/needs, and the more detailed mechanics of the project.
        Note: There are to be significant tangible artifacts towards the project completion that are delivered by the submission of
        ASSIGNMENT 3, so keep this in mind when brainstorming your IT Project Idea for Assignment 2 – Feasibility is a key factor.</p>
